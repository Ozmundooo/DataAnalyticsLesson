          <p><b>Conventions</b> – Sometimes accounting and personal convention get incorporated in the formulas of data which leads to what looks to be altered results that can seem worrisome. For example, if a company does their pay outs every two weeks, the profits of the company will see a dip every two weeks.</p>
          <p><b>Mistakes in formulas</b> – As seen in the previous examples using excel, formulas were used to find the values of the Mean, Median and Mode, as easy as it was to input those formulas it is just as easy to misinput them</p>
          <p><b>Migration Issues</b> – When data is shifted to a different server/database management system, this causes the data to be stored in a different fashion which will may not allow some of the data to compile properly resulting in skewed results</p>
